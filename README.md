# QCPU1Assembler
Hey! I'm ProgrammerArchie, also known as Best_Archer.
This is a repository for an assembler written in C++ for the QCPU 1, a Minecraft Redstone CPU created by
QSmally.
# Description
This program converts Assembly code written for the QCPU 1 into machine code written for the QCPU 1. It takes a path to a source file and a path to a destination file as input, and puts the generated machine code in the destination file. This project was made for fun by me, as a little middle of the night exercise. If you want a link to the ISA, here it is: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-tPUTmeeIqXrqHCRS3xfTa6rvlclP2WCtQUhcKbS9gk/edit?gid=1923054788#gid=1923054788
